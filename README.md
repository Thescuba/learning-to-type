# learning-to-type
For most of my life I had always looked at the keyboard to type and that had held me back on how much work I felt I could get done. I had recently started learning to type without looking the the keyboard and want to make sure that I start to improve on my skill. To do this I plan on tracking all the things I type and using some magic of code, learn which word I struggle with. The words will be kept in a bank so I am able build the muscle memeory for these speific words.
